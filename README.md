# Virtual-Strokes-World
virtual-Strokes World is a real-time drawing application that allows users
to create digital artwork using hand gestures captured by a webcam. The
project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and track the user's
hand movements, translating them into drawing commands on a virtual
canvas. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can
select different colors and brush sizes, enabling them to draw with ease and
precision.
